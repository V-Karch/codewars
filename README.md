# The goal of this repository is not necessarily to gain more experience with the same languages I know I am already good at, but to get more experience in languages I am less familiar with

This is the reason for doing each problem in at least 3 different languages. I may still do the problems in languages I am familiar with so I can get a better understanding of how to solve the problem in another language, with presumably less tools available to me.
